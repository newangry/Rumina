/**

 *
 * Uses the [MediaProjection] API to create a [VirtualDisplay] not shown to the user and containing a copy of the
 * user device screen content. An [ImageReader] is attached to this display in order to monitor every new frame
 * displayed on the screen, received in the form of an [Image]. Then, process those Image with [ImageProcessor]
 * according to the current mode (capture/detection). All Image processing code is executed on a background thread
 * (methods annotated with [WorkerThread]), and all results callbacks are executed on the main thread (the thread that
 * has instantiated this class).
 *
 * To start recording, call [startScreenRecord] (see method documentation for permission management). This must be done
 * before any other action on this object. Once the recording isn't necessary anymore, you must stop it by calling
 * [stopScreenRecord] in order to release all resources associated with this object.
 *
 * @param context the Android context.
 * @param stoppedListener notified when the screen record has been stopped by the user.
